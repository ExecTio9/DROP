# DROP
documentation for the recurrent versions of the DROP device

this device was originally created by Adain Barten in 2021 to be used as a remote vessel deployment device

since then, it has been used upwards of 20 times and is in need of repairs and maintenance. With no previous documentation,
it has become the subject of a revamp that will allow for SHC to expand its deployment range along with upgraded recovery systems.
